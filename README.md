# Transcriptomics 🧬
Repository for all that concern Transcriptomics 

This repository has html for both Bulk and Single cell analysis.  
In Bulk we compared the gene expression of cells coming from different tissues. 
Meanwhile for the single cell analysis we anlysed substanzia nigra from an adult human brain. 

Once again the analysis where performed with the help of @gabrielemarchi! 👨🏻‍🔬

note: The R Mark down code is present only for the bulk analysis for now.
